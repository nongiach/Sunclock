Excerpt from the Sunclock README (complete version is in sunclock directory)
--------------------------------

Sunclock is a sophisticated clock for the X Window system.  It is
based on an earlier version by John Mackin, itself derived from the
Suntools program by John Walker.

Sunclock displays a map of the Earth and shows which portion is illuminated
by the sun. It can commute between two states, the "clock window" and
the "map window". The clock window displays a small map of the Earth
and therefore occupies little space on the screen, while the "map window" 
displays a large map and offers more advanced functions: local time
of cities, Sun and Moon position, etc.

Sunclock versions 3.xx are released under the GPL.

X11 version by John Mackin, <john@cs.su.oz.AU>, based on a Suntools program
by John Walker, <kelvin@acad.uu.NET>.

This program is a clock that shows which portion of the Earth's surface is
illuminated by the Sun.  It is designed to be usually iconic, but can be
opened for a larger display with the time updated every second and both the
local timezone and UTC displayed.  The Suntools version had a menu that
allowed you to speed up time, show different dates, etc., but I have
never implemented any of that in the X version; there is some support
for it in the code, however.
