INSTALLATION instructions
=========================

1. (Optional)
Customize the Sunclockrc file and add locations of cities you would like
to see appearing on sunclock's main map. Information on geographic
coordinates of many important cities (probably with a bias towards 
North America) is included in the "coordinates.txt" file. This
will provide system wide data. After the install, users will still
have the possibility to produce their own settings in ~/.sunclockrc
(same format as for Sunclockrc), which can either supplement or 
supersede the system wide settings.

2. (Optional)
If your native language is not one of the currently supported languages, 
translate Sunclock_en into Sunclock_XX where XX are the initials of the 
desired language, as referred to by the environment parameter $LANG
(already supported internationalization files are located in the 
subdirectory i18n). And please send Sunclock_XX to the current maintainer 
(demailly@fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr) so that it can be included in later
releases...

3. Type 'xmkmf' and then 'make' to build the binary executable. If
your system does not support the Imakefile process, customize by hand
the Makefile.noimake file and type 'make -f Makefile.noimake'

4. Install the binary and app-defaults files
Type 'make install' (respectively 'make -f Makefile.noimake install').
(the man page will be automatically installed as well)
You should be done and have sunclock running properly!

The most basic help is obtained by typing 
   sunclock -help,
and the man page is accessed by clicking 'h' twice while running the 
program.
