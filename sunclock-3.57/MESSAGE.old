Starting from version 3.30 on, the recommended image format is JPEG,
(although you can still use the .xpm or .xpm.gz format as before).
We suggest you to download (actually very nice!) Earth maps from the
xglobe/xplanet home sites
   http://www.radcyberzine.com/xglobe/
   http://www.vterrain.org/Imagery/whole_earth.html
   http://apollo.spaceports.com/~jhasting/planets.html

This version has A POWERFUL ZOOM IMPLEMENTATION !!
If you want to get the full power of it, you can use the huge 11Mb jpeg 
Earth map from 
    http://apollo.spaceports.com/~jhasting/earth.html
    ftp://ftp.ac-grenoble.fr/ge/geosciences/sunclock_huge_earthmap.jpg

Starting from version 3.42 on, the format of the RC config files has been
slightly changed. The -addcity option replaces the former [Cities] more
rigid syntax. Older tags [Options] and [Cities] SHOULD NO LONGER be used.
BOTH the system wide Sunclockrc and the user's private ~/.sunclockrc are 
now read by sunclock at start-up, so cities defined in Sunclockrc
SHOULD NOT BE REDEFINED in ~/.sunclockrc

In 3.43, the -spotsize option has been changed to -spotsizes, and its 
behaviour HAS BEEN CHANGED

In 3.44, the syntax of ALL COLOR OPTIONS HAS CHANGED. A unique option
-setcolor field|color is to be used instead.  Similarly, options
-monochrome, -invertcolors and -fullcolors have been replaced by a single 
option -colorlevel <value> (0, 1, 2, 3)

3.44/3.45 have introduced the ability to DISPLAY MAPS ON THE ROOT WINDOW
3.46 can be used as a SCREENSAVER (-screensaver option)
