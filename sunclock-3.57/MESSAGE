In 3.51, support for GIF and PNG images has been ADDED

Strating with 3.55/3.56, the VMF format has been SLIGHTLY IMPROVED. Three
vector maps are now provided in the source package :
  timezones.vmf (time zone boundaries = new default map)
  countries.vmf (political boundaries)
  landwater.vmf (simple land/water boundaries, = default in zoom widget)

Our companion program 'xrmap' can be used to visualize and produce more
accurate vector maps of the Earth, using the CIA world data bank II and
other public domain data, check
   ftp://ftp.ac-grenoble.fr/ge/geosciences/xrmap

More information on geographic names, city coordinates, timezones can be 
obtained from
   http://gnpswww.nima.mil/geonames/GNS/

Bundled packages of Earth maps from various sources (NASA, xglobe/xplanet
& VTerrain projects, ...) are provided in
   ftp://ftp.ac-grenoble.fr/ge/geosciences/sunclock/data_packages
